export declare const PROMPT = "Use this tool to create or overwrite files inside the sandbox.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Paths must stay inside the sandbox root. The SDK will deny attempts to escape the workspace.\n- Provide the full target contents. The previous file body will be replaced.\n- Pair with fs_read when editing existing files so the FilePool can validate freshness.\n- The tool returns the number of bytes written for auditing purposes.\n\nSafety/Limitations:\n- File freshness validation ensures you don't overwrite externally modified files.\n- Large file writes are allowed but may impact performance.";
