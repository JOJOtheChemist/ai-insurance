export declare const DESCRIPTION = "Edit a file by replacing old_string with new_string";
export declare const PROMPT = "Use this tool for precise in-place edits.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Provide a unique \"old_string\" snippet to replace. If multiple matches exist, set \"replace_all\" to true.\n- Combine with fs_read to confirm the current file state before editing.\n- The tool integrates with FilePool to ensure the file has not changed externally.\n- If old_string is not unique, the tool will reject the operation unless replace_all is true.\n\nSafety/Limitations:\n- Single replacements require exact unique matches to avoid unintended changes.\n- Freshness validation prevents conflicts with external modifications.";
