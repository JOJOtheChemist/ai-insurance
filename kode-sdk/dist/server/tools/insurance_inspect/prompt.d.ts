export declare const PROMPT = "Use this tool to read detailed fields of a specific product using its ID.\n\nSupported parameters:\n- product_id: The ID of the product.\n- fields: Comma-separated list of fields (e.g. \"product_name,coverage,extend_info\").\n  * Supports DOT notation for nested access: \"coverage.\u731D\u6B7B\u4FDD\u9669\u91D1\", \"extend_info.life_features\".\n- view: \"full\" (default) or \"summary\".\n\nCRITICAL - LAZY LOADING STRATEGY:\n1. Always start with view=\"summary\" when querying 'coverage' or 'extend_info'.\n   Example: inspect(id=43, fields=\"coverage,extend_info\", view=\"summary\")\n   Why? Because these fields are huge. Summary view returns only the KEYS.\n   \n2. Once you see the keys (e.g. coverage_keys=[\"\u731D\u6B7B\"]), you can DRILL DOWN.\n   Example: inspect(id=43, fields=\"coverage.\u731D\u6B7B\")\n   \n3. Only use view=\"full\" if you are certain the content is small or you absolutely need everything.";
