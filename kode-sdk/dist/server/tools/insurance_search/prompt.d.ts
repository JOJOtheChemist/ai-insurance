export declare const PROMPT = "Use this tool to search/retrieve products by keywords.\nThis tool searches effectively across:\n- Product Name\n- Description\n- Extended Info (JSON tables, highlights)\n- Coverage (Detailed terms) [Optimization: Coverage is fully indexed]\n\nSupported parameters:\n- keyword: The search term (e.g. \"\u731D\u6B7B\", \"\u7259\u79D1\", \"\u6EE1\u671F\u91D1\").\n- limit: Number of top results to return (default: 5).\n\nBest Practice:\n- Use this when the user has a specific \"need\" or \"scenario\" (e.g. \"I want coverage for sudden death\").\n- If the first broad search yields too many results, refine the keyword.";
