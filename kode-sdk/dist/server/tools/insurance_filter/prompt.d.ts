export declare const PROMPT = "Use this tool to filter insurance products based on hard criteria.\nThis tool is best used for PRECISE filtering when you have specific constraints.\n\nSupported parameters:\n- age_min / age_max: Filter by detailed age range (e.g. 18-60). The system supports smart parsing of age strings.\n- product_type: Exact match for product type (e.g. \"\u91CD\u75BE\u9669\", \"\u533B\u7597\u9669\", \"\u5B9A\u671F\u5BFF\u9669\", \"\u610F\u5916\u9669\").\n\nBest Practice:\n- Use this as the FIRST step to narrow down the pool of 40+ products.\n- If the user provides a specific age (e.g. \"30 years old\"), ALWAYS use age_min=30, age_max=30.";
